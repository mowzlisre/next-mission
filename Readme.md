# NeXT Mission

**Navigating eXperience and Transitions**  
An AI-powered platform to support U.S. military veterans as they transition to civilian life.

---

## Overview

**NeXT Mission** is a web-based prototype designed to guide both retired and transitioning veterans through key areas of post-service life. It combines a structured resume builder, real-time chatbot assistant, mentor discovery engine, and a social forum into one unified platform.

Built with a Django + Vue.js architecture, this project leverages **Meta's LLaMA 4 Scout 17B 16E Instruct** model, served through Groq, for all text generation tasksâ€”from civilian resume enrichment to dynamic conversational support.

This project was developed for the **ai+expo hackathon** on **Meta Track**, with an emphasis on showcasing how Meta's models can create impactful, real-world applications.
